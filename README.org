#+TITLE: Browser httpRequest implementation

This packages holds implementation of =HttpRequest= (from
=0k.io/types-request=), a simple http request facility using
the standard =fetch()= interface.

This should work in any browser and WebView when run in android
or iOS.


* Adding =@0k.io/browser-request= to your project

From the root of your project:

#+begin_src sh
npm install --save @0k.io/browser-request
#+end_src

Or better, as =browser-request= is still in early release,

#+begin_src sh
npm install --save 0k/browser-request#master
#+end_src

To be sure to get the latest version, relaunch this last command
whenever you want to update.

* Developer

** Building the project from fresh clone

#+begin_src sh
npm install
#+end_src

** Transpilation to JavaScript

#+begin_src sh
npx tsc
#+end_src

or with watch support:

#+begin_src sh
npx tsc -w
#+end_src
